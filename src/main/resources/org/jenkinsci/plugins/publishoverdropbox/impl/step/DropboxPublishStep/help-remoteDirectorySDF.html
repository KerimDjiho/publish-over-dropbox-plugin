    <p>Select this to include the timestamp in the remote directory.</p>

    <p>
        The timestamp is the date of build. This setting turns the remote directory option into a java SimpleDateFormat.
        The SimpleDateFormat(SDF) uses letters to represent components of the date, like the month, year, or day of the
        week. The <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html">SimpleDateFormat
        documentation</a> has more information about the date patterns. As the SDF reserves all of the
        letters [A-Z][a-z], any that you want to appear literally in the directory that is created will need to be
        quoted.

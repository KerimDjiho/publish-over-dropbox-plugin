    <p>First part of the file path that should not be created on the remote server.</p>
    <p>Directory structures are created relative to the base directory, which is usually the workspace.You normally do
        not want the full path to these files to be created on the server. For example if Source files were
        target/deployment/images/**/ then you may want Remove prefix to be target/deployment This would create the
        images folder under the remote directory, and not target/deployment
        If you use remove prefix, then ALL source file paths MUST start with the prefix.</p>
